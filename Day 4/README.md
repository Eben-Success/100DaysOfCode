# RANDOMIZATION IN PYTHON
## Using List in Python

## Instructions
This is a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails
