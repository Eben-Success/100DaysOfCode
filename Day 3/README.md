# LOVE CALCULATOR

This program test the compatibility between two people. I'll be using the super scientific method recommended by BuzzFeed

* To work out the love score between two people:
  * Take both people's name and check for the number of times the letter in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letter in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
* This BuzzFeed article gives more details on this:

* For Love Score less than 10 or greater than 90, the message is:
"Your score x, you go together like coke and mentos"

* For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message is:
"Your score is y, you are alright together."

* Otherwise, the message is just their score:
"Your score is z."
