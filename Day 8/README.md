### CAESAR CIPHER PROJECT
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and 
simplest methods of encryption technique. 
Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, 
i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced 
by a letter with a fixed number of positions down 
the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1,
A would be replaced by B, B would become C,
and so on.
