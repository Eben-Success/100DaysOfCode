## The use of for loop and the range() function.

### The final project for Day 5 is PyPassword Generator.

It consists of two different files: PyPassword_Generator_Easy_Level and 
the PyPassword_Generator_Hard_Level.

Both Password generators allows users to specify the number of 
numbers, letters and symbols they want to 
include in their password, however, the hard level, randomized the password, once
it is generated. The easy level on the other hand always displays the characters at the specific indexes. This 
makes it easy to be cracked by a hacker.
